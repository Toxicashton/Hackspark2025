As part of the Healthcare Appointment Booking System developed during our hackathon project, I applied my Java programming skills to implement and test key backend functionalities in the prototype phase. Although our main backend was built using Node.js and MongoDB, I initially utilized Java for building and simulating critical logic components such as appointment scheduling, user authentication flows, and data model validation.  I created POJO classes (Doctor, Patient, Appointment) to represent domain entities. These were crucial in modeling the structure of the database and planning how the objects would interact in real-time. Java’s object-oriented features allowed for clear abstraction and modularization of responsibilities across different layers such as controllers, services, and data handling.  Additionally, I implemented core scheduling algorithms in Java to validate time slot availability and prevent overlapping appointments. Using Java’s date and time API (java.time.LocalDateTime), I ensured that appointment requests respected doctor availability and business rules. Exception handling and conditional checks were added to make the system resilient against invalid user inputs.  To simulate token-based authentication, I used Java libraries such as java-jwt to generate and verify JWT tokens, which allowed us to design and test secure access to user-specific endpoints before full Node.js integration. This provided insights into how stateless session handling would be implemented in the final backend system.  Overall, applying Java during the early phases of the project helped rapidly prototype complex logic, validate backend models, and refine our understanding of system flows. It showcased Java’s strengths in backend logic design, making it a valuable tool even in a cross-stack development process.
